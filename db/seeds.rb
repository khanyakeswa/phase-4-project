I was born in the Happy Valley, PA, grew up in Johannesburg, South Africa, and finished high school in the suburban Philadelphia area. Design as an influence has been a driving presence in my career, and I hope to carry that intent forward into future engineering roles. A unique aspect of myself is my ability to empathize with one's thoughts and ambitions, and pursue solutions in kind. I'm excited to utilize my proficiency in human factors and product design to bridge the gaps between a team and the people it seeks to serve.",
